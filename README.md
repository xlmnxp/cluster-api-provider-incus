Kubernetes-native declarative infrastructure for [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/), [Canonical LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) and [Canonical MicroCloud](https://canonical.com/microcloud).

## What is the Cluster API Provider Incus

[Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io) is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters.

`cluster-api-provider-incus` (CAPN) is an Infrastructure Provider for Cluster API, which enables deploying clusters on infrastructure operated by [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/), [Canonical LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) and [Canonical MicroCloud](https://canonical.com/microcloud).

The provider can be used in single-node development environments for evaluation and testing, but also work with multi-node clusters to deploy and manage production Kubernetes clusters.

## Documentation

Please refer to our [book](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org) for in-depth documentation.

## Quick Start

See [Quick Start](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/tutorial/quick-start.html) to launch a cluster on a single-node development environment.

## Features

- Supports [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/), [Canonical LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) and [Canonical MicroCloud](https://canonical.com/microcloud).
- Support for [kube-vip](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/reference/templates/kube-vip.html) (production), [OVN network load balancers](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/reference/templates/ovn.html) or simple [haproxy containers](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/reference/templates/development.html) (development) for the cluster load balancer.
- [Default simplestreams server](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/reference/default-simplestreams-server.html) with pre-built kubeadm images.
- Supports virtual machines or LXC containers for the cluster machines. Automatically manages the [profile](https://capn.linuxcontainers.org/reference/profile/kubeadm.html) for Kubernetes to work in LXC containers.
- Can be used for local development similar to CAPD for quickly iterating on custom bootstrap and control-plane providers, e.g. K3s, Canonical Kubernetes, etc.

## Project Roadmap

### v0.9.0

Rough steps for version v0.9.0:

- [ ] Use `kini` for quick start guide.
- [ ] Load balancer IPAM (CAPN automatically claims/releases load balancer IP addresses from the network).
- [x] Add `kini` command line tool, re-using building blocks from [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io).
- [x] Use `kini` for e2e tests.
- [x] Build images for v1.34.0, based on Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13.
- [x] Private initial alpha testing.
- [x] Cloud provider node patch to link Machines with workload cluster Nodes.
- [x] Test with both [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/) and [Canonical LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd).
- [x] Start cluster-api-provider-incus book with quick start guide, cluster templates, API reference.
- [x] Publish v0.1.0 release to get initial user feedback.
- [x] Add e2e tests using the cluster-api testing framework.
- [x] Add PR blocking CI pipelines.
- [x] Publish v0.2.0 release with v1alpha2 APIs.
- [x] Add e2e tests for cluster upgrades.
- [x] Explore clusters with ClusterTopology=true (clusterclass), also allows us to run all existing ClusterAPI e2e tests like Autoscaler, etc.
- [x] Write developer guide.
- [x] Support unprivileged containers.
- [x] Support configurable machine placement for production clusters.
- [x] Extend e2e suite with tests for all cluster-template types (kvm, unprivileged containers, kube-vip, ovn)
- [x] Add self-hosted e2e test.
- [x] Implement `kind` instance types (using OCI containers with the kindest/node images from the kind project).
- [x] Gather initial user feedback.
- [ ] Improve generated API reference documentation.
- [ ] Add cluster-templates for 3rd party providers, e.g. [Canonical Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/cluster-api-k8s).
- [ ] Write documentation with common troubleshooting steps.
- [ ] Write documentation with common cluster deployment scenarios.

### $Future

- [ ] [Migrate to for ClusterAPI v1beta2 contract](https://github.com/lxc/cluster-api-provider-incus/pull/133).
- [ ] Add to default list of providers supported by ClusterAPI.
- [ ] Improve API validations and possibly API conformance tests.
- [x] Add CI to build kubeadm images for the default simplestreams server. Pushing will remain manual for now.
- [x] Decide on project OWNERSHIP and testing infrastructure (part of LXC org).
- [x] Refactor `internal/incus` package and improve consistency and log levels across the code.
- [ ] Split cloud provider node patch to external cloud-provider-incus project.
